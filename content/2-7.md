## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module:

* explain accessible coding to create rich applications such as single page applications or those rendered using JavaScript
* demonstrate how structure and relationships, document objects management, keyboard and focus interactions, notifications, and updates enable people with disabilities to interact with rich applications

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how assistive technologies communicate dynamically generated content changes as opposed to page reloads
* explain how structure and relationships, document objects management, keyboard and focus interactions, notifications, and updates enable people with disabilities to operate rich applications
* code coherent overall structure and relationships across rich application widgets that are perceived by people with disabilities
* code states across application widgets using appropriate DOM management techniques so that they allow assistive technologies to render contents efficiently and responsively
* code the necessary reading and keyboard focus order to navigate within rich applications using multiple input devices
* code prioritization of notifications and updates that allow people with disabilities to check them at their pace and convenience
* code mechanisms to switch notifications on or off to avoid conflicts with assistive technologies presenting several notifications at the same time

## Topics to Teach

Topics to support the teaching sequence:

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Structure and Relationships

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate the use of markup and coding techniques to communicate structural elements that are common to the application as a whole, such as titles, headings, or regions. Explain that these elements need to be updated according to the view changes and overall visual appearance.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code updates to applications' titles using the HTML element `title`
* code updates to applications' headings using  the HTML elements `h1` through `h6`, and using the WAI-ARIA properties `role="heading'` and `level="1-6"` when standard HTML elements cannot be used
* code updates to applications' regions to mark up the visual rendering of application views using HTML5 sections
* code updates for applications' structural elements such as titles, headings, and regions as view changes occur

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Refer back to module 1, [Structure and Semantics](/curricula/developer-modules/structure-and-semantics/). Demonstrate the use of voice commands, keystrokes, or gestures provided by speech and mainstream technologies to query for the application title. Explain that this title is conveyed using the HTML element `title`, and that it should be updated to describe the currently displayed application view. 
* Refer back to module 1, [Structure and Semantics](/curricula/developer-modules/structure-and-semantics/). Demonstrate the use of voice commands, keystrokes, or gestures provided by speech and mainstream technologies to navigate using the application headings. Explain that these headings should be updated accordingly to match any major view change.
* Demonstrate overall interaction with rich applications using assistive technologies. Compare examples where assistive technologies communicate the elements that are displayed with other examples where assistive technologies may access information that is not currently on screen. Emphasize that document object model layers should be added and removed depending on the application view, so that assistive technologies only access the ones that are visible.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a rich application that contains several views and are asked to code and update the titles for each of the views matching the visual appearance of the application. Assess students' knowledge of how to code and update application titles.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with different application views and are asked to code the section headings for each of the view sections. Assess students' knowledge of how to update application headings to convey the overall application structure
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a rich application containing different views and are asked to code mechanisms to update titles,  headings, and regions depending on the currently visible section. Assess students' knowledge of how to code updates for application structural components.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a rich application containing different views that show and hide based on user interaction and are asked to update the DOM structure accordingly. Assess students' knowledge of how to provide a coherent DOM structure depending on the  displayed application widgets.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Document Objects Management

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate how assistive technologies interact with rich applications as application widgets become visible or hidden. Provide examples of different mechanisms to communicate application widgets states such as use of `aria-hidden`, adding, or removing DOM layers.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code additions or removals to the document object model that match applications visual appearance 
* code the `hidden` state of application widgets using the WAI-ARIA property `aria-hidden="true"` or removing the corresponding layers from the DOM
* code the `displayed` state of application widgets using the WAI-ARIA property `aria-hidden="false'` or adding them to the DOM when they become visible 
* ensure DOM nodes of modal windows are the only ones that assistive technologies have access to when such dialogs are in view
* ensure DOM nodes for modal windows are not accessed by assistive technologies when they are no longer in view
* ensure DOM cleanup for nodes that are no longer used or are not currently visible

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Demonstrate navigation between several application widgets using an assistive technology. Explain how these components show or hide depending on user action. For example, when the user goes to the menu bar, the other application widgets may be hidden or greyed out. Emphasize that these states need to be programmatically marked up using `aria-hidden`, or removing the unnecessary elements from the DOM.
* Refer back to previous modules to demonstrate the use of `aria-hidden` to hide application widgets from assistive technologies. . The `true` value indicates that the component is not currently displayed, and the `false` value indicates that the component is currently visible. Explain that `aria-hidden` removes each component from the accessibility tree and all its descendants, so it must be used with caution as the elements to which it is applied are completely inaccessible for assistive technologies.
* Demonstrate accessible and inaccessible modal windows. Emphasize how assistive technologies can access only the relevant elements of such dialogs when they have been coded appropriately. Explain that `aria-hidden="true"` should be applied to the contents that are not part of the modal window as long as it is displayed, and that `aria-hidden="false"` should be given to the background elements when the modal disappears.


#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with a rich application that takes some time to load data and are asked to code mechanisms to inform users that the application is waiting for data to load. Assess students' knowledge of how to code mechanisms to inform users of data processing.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with different application views and are asked to code their `displayed` or `hidden` states using `aria-hidden` together with its corresponding value. Assess students' knowledge of how to code `displayed` and `hidden` states of application views.

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Keyboard and Focus Interactions

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate the use of coding techniques to make all necessary elements of the interface focusable, such as use of natively focusable HTML elements or the attribute `tabindex`. Mention common keyboard operations, such as changing views or selecting specific components.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code focusable elements of a given view using natively focusable HTML elements or `tabindex="0"
* code application widgets that are not focusable at a given stage using `tabindex="-1"
* explain how keyboard operations such as using the tab key or using dedicated keystrokes enable people with disabilities to move between different application widgets
* set focus based on application views, dialogs, errors, or events that require user intervention
* code shortcut keys that allow to navigate across and interact with application widgets 
* code document object model (DOM) orders that matches applications' visual reading order
* code mechanisms that allow users to obtain information about the available keyboard combinations when applications use non-standard keyboard shortcuts

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Refer back to previous modules and explain that the tab sequence needs to be preserved so that keyboard users can navigate between the different application widgets, such as different toolbars or menus that the application may contain. Emphasize that HTML standard elements are recommended regardless of the nature of the application in use, as they inherit all the necessary semantic properties that make them usable with the keyboard. If a non-standard element needs to be used, explain that `tabindex="0"` needs to be added so that it can receive keyboard focus.
* Demonstrate use of common shortcut keys for rich applications, such as to create a new message in a web-based email client or to move to the menu bar in a web-based word processor. Explain that these shortcut keys should avoid any conflict with key combinations of both browsers and assistive technologies. Emphasize that application functionality should rely as much as possible on standard keyboard conventions, as non-standard keyboard shortcuts may sometimes be difficult to remember for some users or impossible to use due to their specific configurations.
* Refer back to module 5, [Forms and Controls](/curricula/developer-modules/forms-and-controls/). Explain techniques to set focus to the most relevant place in an application, such as a newly loaded view, the default button in a dialog, or the element that originated a modal window. Mention that setting focus to the most relevant place in a rich application is a shared responsibility among different team members: designers and developers.
* Demonstrate the use of mechanisms to obtain information about the available keyboard shortcuts in rich applications such as web-based email clients, spreadsheets, or word processors. Explain that when an application makes extensive use of non-standard keyboard shortcuts, a mechanism that allows users to obtain information about these shortcuts is necessary. Mention that providing such messages is a shared responsibility among different team members: designers and developers.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with an application with several views that show or hide based on user interaction and are asked to set focus to the specific displayed widget. Assess students' knowledge of how to place focus on a specific application widget based on its state or relevance.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with an application that makes extensive use of non-standard keyboard shortcuts and are asked to code a help widget that explains such keyboard shortcuts. Assess students' knowledge of how to provide specific help based on the implemented application keyboard shortcuts.
* Practical &mdash; Students are presented with an application containing modal dialogs and are asked to set focus to the most relevant place based on user interaction. Assess students' knowledge of how to set focus to the dialog when it appears and to the element that originated it when it disappears.

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Updates and Notifications

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Demonstrate the use of mechanisms to prioritize updates and notifications based on user interaction or relevance of the update.

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* code messages to inform about new data loads or view selections
* code notifications based on user interaction, such as when an email has been sent or when the user wants to quit without saving changes in a word processor
* code status messages that announce the newly selected view after a view change using live regions
* code mechanisms to prioritize updates and to decide which of those updates should interrupt users and which should not
* code mechanisms to enable users of assistive technologies to review updates and notifications at their pace and convenience

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Demonstrate interaction with application dialogs that may result in data loss or in critical errors. Compare assistive technologies interaction with accessible and inaccessible examples. Explain that, when these messages are populated, these should be given high priority in the list of the live regions so that user can take action to avoid data loss or to solve the problem.
* Demonstrate interaction with applications as they load new data. Explain that these data exchanges might be visually apparent but could be skipped by users of assistive technologies if they are not marked up correctly. Emphasize that live regions (explained in previous modules) are used to indicate that new data is being loaded or that there is a waiting time should be provided so that users are aware of what is going on.
* Demonstrate assistive technology interaction with rich applications such as a single page application. Explain that assistive technologies may not perceive dynamic content changes by default unless there is a page reload. Emphasize that each time the view changes, a message indicating the currently selected  view should be provided to assistive technologies via a live region.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge

Optional ideas to support assessment:

* Practical &mdash; Students are asked to code an alert to prevent user from quitting a word processor without saving changes. Assess students' knowledge of mechanisms to provide such alerts.
* Practical &mdash; Students are asked to provide a message indicating the view that is currently displayed. Assess students' knowledge of how to provide individual notifications based on the currently selected application view

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

* Practical &mdash; Students are guided to use different mechanisms that assistive technologies provide to navigate within rich applications, such as move through headings, regions, and interact with updates and notifications. Assess students’ knowledge of mechanisms of assistive technologies to interact and operate rich applications.
* Portfolio &mdash; Students build an accessible single page application. Assess students' knowledge of how to communicate structural elements state changes, keyboard and focus interactions, notifications, and updates to assistive technologies.
